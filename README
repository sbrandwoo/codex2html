This script takes a directory of text files, each using Markdown to specify
formatting and converts them to HTML. A microsite is built using Twitter's
bootstrap allowing easy navigation and viewing of the files.

Handy for seeing those personal notebooks in a web browser with eye-friendly
styles.

Usage:
    build_codex.py source_directory target_directory
